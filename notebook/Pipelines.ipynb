Delivery The system must deliver data to the correct destination. Data \\nmust be received by the intended device or user and only by that device or \\nuser. \\n2. Accuracy The system must deliver the data accurately. Data should not be \\naltered. If the data is altered in transmission and left uncorrected are unusable. \\n3. Timeliness The system must deliver data in a timely manner. Data delivered late are \\nuseless. In the case of video and audio, timely delivery means delivering data \\nas they are produced, in the same order that they are produced and without \\nsignificant delay. This kind of delivery is called real-time transmission. \\n4. Jitter It refers to the variation in the packet arrival time. Jitter is the uneven \\ndelay in the delivery of audio or video packets. \\nExample: Let us assume that video packets are sent every 3ms. If some of the packets \\narrive  \\nwith 3ms delay and others with 4ms delay, an uneven quality in the video is the result. \\n \\nComponents: \\nA data communications system has five components: \\n1. Message: The message is the information (data) to be communicated. \\nPopular forms of information include text, numbers, pictures, audio, and \\nvideo. \\n2. Sender: The sender is the device that sends the data message. It can be a \\ncomputer, workstation, telephone handset, video camera, and so on. \\n3. Receiver: The receiver is the device that receives the message. It can be a \\ncomputer, workstation, telephone handset, television, and so on. \\n4. Transmission medium: The transmission medium is the physical path by \\nwhich a message travels from sender to receiver. Some examples of \\ntransmission media include twisted-pair wire, coaxial cable, fiber-optic \\ncable, and radio waves. \\n5. Protocol:  A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communications. It \\nrepresents an agreement between the communicating devices. Without a \\nprotocol, two devices may be connected but not communicating, just as a'),\n",

(i.e.) for each node there is a link to all other nodes. \\n• The term Dedicated means that the link carries traffic only between the two devices it \\nconnects. \\nAdvantages: \\n1. A mesh topology is robust. If one link becomes unusable, it does not affect the entire \\nsystem. \\n2. The use of dedicated links guarantees that each connection can carry its own data  load, \\nthus eliminating the traffic problems that can occur when links must be  shared by \\nmultiple devices. \\n3.

The devices are not directly linked to one another. \\n• A star topology does not allow direct traffic between devices. The controller acts as an \\nexchange: If one device wants to send data to another, it sends the data to the controller, and \\nthe controller transfers the data to the other connected device. \\nAdvantages: \\n1. A star topology is less expensive than a mesh topology. In a star, each device needs only one \\nlink and one I/O port to connect it to any number of others. This factor also makes it easy to \\ninstall and reconfigure \\n2. Less cabling is required than mesh topology. \\n3. Star topology is robust, If one link fails, only that link is affected.

Here the cable is called the bus. \\n• Bus topology was the one of the first topologies used in the design of early local area \\nnetworks. \\n• Nodes are connected to the bus cable by drop lines and taps. \\n• A drop line is a connection running between the device and the main cable. \\n• A tap is a connector that splices into (attached to) the main cable. \\n \\nAdvantages: \\n1. Installation is easy. Bus Backbone cable can be laid along the most efficient path and then \\nconnected to the nodes by drop lines of various lengths. \\n2. A bus uses less cabling than mesh or star topologies. \\nDisadvantages: \\n1.

Heat degrades the quality of \\nsignal. \\nRing Topology \\n• In a ring topology, each device has a dedicated point-to-point connection with only the \\ntwo devices on either side of it. \\n• A signal is passed along the ring in one direction from device to device, until it reaches its \\ndestination. \\n• Each device in the ring incorporates a repeater. When a device receives a signal intended \\nfor another device, its repeater regenerates the bits and passes them along. \\n \\n \\nAdvantages: \\n1. A ring is relatively easy to install and reconfigure. Each device is linked to only its \\nimmediate neighbors (either physically or logically). \\n2. To add or delete a device requires changing only two connections. \\n3. The only constraints are media and traffic considerations (maximum ring length and \\nnumber of devices). \\nDisadvantage: \\n1. Unidirectional traffic can be a disadvantage. \\n2.

Some of these frames collide because multiple frames are in contention for the  \\nshared channel. \\n By observing the above figure only 2 frames frame 1.1 and frame 3.2 can be delivered at  \\nreceiver, and the remaining frames collide with each other and they are lost or discarded \\nat the receiver side. \\n The pure ALOHA protocol relies on Acknowledgments (ACK) from the receiver. When a \\nstation sends a frame, it expects the receiver to send an acknowledgment. \\n If the acknowledgment does not arrive after a time-out period, the station assumes that the \\nframe (or the acknowledgment) has been destroyed and resends the frame. \\n A collision involves two or more stations. If all these stations try to resend their frames  \\nafter the time-out, the frames will collide again. \\n Pure ALOHA dictates that when the time -out period passes, each station waits a random  \\namount of time before resending its frame. The randomness will help avoid more collisions; \\nthis time is called the Back-Off Time TB. \\n Pure ALOHA has a second method to prevent conges ting the channel with retransmitted  \\nframes. After a maximum number of retransmission attempts Kmax a station must give up  \\nand try later.'),\n",

Source Quench \\n• The source-quench message in ICMP was designed to add a \\nkind of flow control to the IP. \\n• When a router or host discards a datagram due to congestion, it \\nsends a source- quench message to the sender of the datagram. \\nThis message has two purposes. \\n• First, it informs the source that the datagram has been discarded. \\n• Second, it warns the source that there is congestion somewhere in \\nthe path and  that the source should slow down (quench) the \\nsending process. \\nc. Time Exceeded \\nThe time-exceeded message is generated in two cases: \\nCase1: As routers use routing tables to find the next hop (next router) that \\nmust receive the packet. If there are errors in one or more routing tables, \\na packet can travel in a loop or a cycle, going from one router to the \\nnext or visiting  a series of routers endlessly.  Each datagram contains a \\nfield called time to live that controls this situation. When a datagram visits \\na router, the value of this field is decremented by 1. When the time-to- \\nlive value reaches 0, after decrementing, the router discards the datagram. \\nHowever, when the datagram is discarded, a time -exceeded message \\nmust be sent by the router to the original source.'),\n",

Parameter Problem \\nAny ambiguity in the  header part of a  datagram can  create serious \\nproblems as the datagram travels through the Internet. If a router or the \\ndestination host discovers an ambiguous or missing value in any field of \\nthe datagram, it discards the datagram and  sends a parameter-problem \\nmessage back to the source. \\n \\ne.

Telephony, audio conferencing, \\nvideo conferencing, and remote log-in need minimum delay. \\nJitter:It is the variation in delay for packets belonging to the same flow.

Each priority class has its \\nown queue. \\n• The packets in the highest-priority queue are processed first. Packets in the lowest- \\npriority queue are processed last. \\n• The system does not stop serving a queue until it is empty.'),\n",

There are three types of reconfiguration: \\ni. Hardware reconfiguration: It covers all changes to the hardware. These \\nare handled manually. Example: A sub network (Router) may be added or \\nremoved from the network. \\nii. Software reconfiguration: It covers all changes to the software. Most of \\nthe software reconfiguration can be automated. Example: Updating \\nOperating system. \\niii. User-account reconfiguration: It covers adding and deleting the users \\non a system and it also considers user’s individual privileges and Group \\nprivileges. \\nExample: A user may have read and write permission with regard to some \\nfiles, but only read permission with regard to other files. \\nDocumentation \\nThe network configuration and each subsequent change in hardware, \\nsoftware and user accounts must be documented.'),\n",

Example: A fault may be a damaged \\ncommunication medium. \\nFault management system has two subsystems: Reactive and Proactive. \\nReactive Fault Management \\nThe responsibilities of reactive fault management can be divided into 4 steps: \\ni. Detect the fault: Fault management system must have to detect the exact \\nlocation of the fault. \\nii. Isolate the fault: If a fault is isolated that affects only a few users. After \\nisolation, the affected users are immediately notified and given an \\nestimated time of correction. \\niii. Correct the fault: This may involve replacing or repairing the faulty components. \\niv. Record the fault: After the fault is corrected, it must be recorded (i.e. \\ndocumented). The record should show the exact location of the fault, the \\npossible cause, the action or actions taken to correct the fault, the cost and \\ntime it took for each step. \\nProactive Fault Management \\nProactive fault management tries to prevent faults from occurring. Some \\nfailures can be predicted and prevented. \\n \\nPerformance Management \\nPerformance management tries to monitor and control the network to ensure \\nthat it is running as efficiently. It can be measured by the following concepts: \\nCapacity, Traffic, Throughput, Response time. \\n• Capacity of the Network Every network has a limited capacity, and the \\nperformance management system must ensure that it is not used above this \\ncapacity.'),\n",

This is called the \\npending error for the socket. \\n• This option can be fetched but cannot be set. \\n• The process can be notified about the error in one of the two ways. \\no If the process is blocked in a call to select on the socket, for either \\nreadability or writability. \\no If the process is using signal driven I/O, the SIGIO signal is generated for \\neither the process or the process group. \\n(5) SO_KEEPALIVE \\n• The purpose of this option is to detect if the peer host crashes or become \\nunreachable. \\n• When the keepalive option is set for a TCP socket and no data has been \\nexchanged across the socket in either direction for 2 hours, TCP automatically \\nsends a keep-alive probe to the peer. \\n• This probe is a TCP segment to which the peer must respond.

The most important one is the network connectivity. \\n• Any interactive bidirectional web application requires, well, an active Internet connection. \\n \\nSend & Receive Messages \\nThe Message event takes place usually when the server sends some data.

The declaration of binary data is done explicitly \\nas follows − \\nsocket.binaryType=”arrayBuffer”; \\nsocket.binaryType=”blob”; \\nStrings \\nStrings are considered to be  useful, dealing with human readable formats such as XML and JSON. \\nWhenever onmessage event is raised, client needs to check the data type and act accordingly. \\nThe code snippet for determining the data type as String is mentioned below − \\nsocket.onmessage=function(event){ \\n \\nif(typeOfevent.data===String){ \\nconsole.log(“Received data string”); \\n} \\n}'),\n",
